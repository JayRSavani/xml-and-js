=> In this project, we worked as a team and distribute our works separately.
=> I got the chance to make the xsl file of the library.
=> I went through all the previous assignments and labs then analyze the process of how xsl file really create.
=> First of all, I define the stylesheet and template decalaration first with the namespace.
=> I create this file for the data given in the xml file which created by another team member and I decide to declare this data in table form and that is the way I learned in the class.
=> First of all, I define the template and basic tags of html and body to start with table.
=> There are two foremost elements which are Library and Catalog. So that, I decided to create two separate tables of these raw data and provide sub-information of those data into the table.
=> With the use of basic table tag like th and td, I created column for these data. The first table I created which include following data: ID, Name, Specialty and Address.
=> Then I assign them xsl values over there.
=> Due to there are multiple tags inside the address, I have to define the path inside the value of tag of the xml.
=> Then I created another table for Catalog, same way I did for the Library table.
=> Catalog table contains the following data: Library ID, ISBN, Title, Description, genre, author, year and availability, where id part is inside the raw data, so I assigned path through it.
=> I created both the tables with the use of for-each loop.
=> I also learn and understand all the files we created as a group from my team members. As a part of this group, I also described this xsl file to my other two team members.
=> Finally, I learn all the things which you assigned us to do and also very well too.
